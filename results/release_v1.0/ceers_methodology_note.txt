TSM2.1 METHODOLOGY NOTE - LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE
======================================================================

WHAT THIS ANALYSIS DOES:
------------------------
1. Demonstrates that the TSM2.1 decomposition EXISTS for all galaxies
2. Shows the required β values are subluminal (< c)
3. Maps the parameter space as a function of assumed N_cosmic scaling

WHAT THIS ANALYSIS CANNOT DO:
-----------------------------
1. Validate or falsify the TSM2.1 model independently
2. Distinguish between different N_cosmic scalings
3. Predict redshifts from independent observables

THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION:
---------------------------
The decomposition uses z_obs as input to derive parameters. This is
inherently circular - we're solving for what bulk velocity would be
REQUIRED to explain z_obs, not testing if the model PREDICTS z_obs.

To properly test TSM2.1 would require:
- Independent velocity measurements (spectroscopy, peculiar velocities)
- HI tomography to measure actual cosmic N_HI along each sightline
- Environmental metrics that correlate with bulk flow velocities

HONEST INTERPRETATION:
---------------------
The analysis shows that TSM2.1 provides a MATHEMATICALLY CONSISTENT
framework - any observed redshift CAN be decomposed into refraction +
Doppler components with physically plausible parameters.

This is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT to validate the model.
It demonstrates internal consistency, not external validity.

FUTURE WORK NEEDED:
-------------------
1. Independent velocity constraints from large-scale structure surveys
2. HI absorption measurements along high-z sightlines
3. Cross-correlation with peculiar velocity catalogs
4. Comparison with standard cosmological predictions
