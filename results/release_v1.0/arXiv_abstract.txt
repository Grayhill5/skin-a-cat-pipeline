TITLE: SKIN-a-CAT: A Refractive-Kinematic Model for Cosmological Redshifts Without Expansion

AUTHORS: [Author Names]

ABSTRACT:

We present SKIN-a-CAT (Static Kinematic INterpretation - a Cosmological 
Alternative Theory), an open-source pipeline demonstrating that observed 
cosmological redshifts across z=0-14 can be decomposed into refractive 
scattering in neutral hydrogen and relativistic bulk velocities within 
static Euclidean space.

The TSM2.1 model posits z_obs = (1 + z_refrac)(1 + z_doppler) - 1, where
z_refrac arises from photon-HI interactions (k = 5.1e-23 cm²) and z_doppler 
from subluminal recession. We calibrate against four benchmark targets:
Bullet Cluster (z=0.296, 99% match), El Gordo (z=0.870, 100%), GN-z11 
(z=10.6, 99.5%), and JADES-GS-z14-0 (z=14.18, 99.9%).

Statistical analysis of 10,000 CEERS catalog galaxies yields 100% valid 
decompositions with mean β=0.73c, R²=0.999, and systematic Doppler/refraction 
contributions of 84%/16%. Sensitivity analysis across N_cosmic scaling 
exponents (1.5-2.5) demonstrates model parameter space constraints.

IMPORTANT LIMITATION: This analysis demonstrates model consistency by 
decomposing observed redshifts, not predictive validation. The methodology 
uses z_obs as input, establishing that valid decompositions exist for any
reasonable HI scaling assumption. Independent velocity measurements and 
HI tomography are required for falsification tests.

The pipeline requires no cosmic expansion, dark energy, or dark matter 
parameters. All velocities remain subluminal; no singularities arise.
We release full source code for reproducibility.
