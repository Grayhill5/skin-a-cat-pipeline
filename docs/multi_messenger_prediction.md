### Multi-Messenger Prediction (Clarified Dec 2025)

TSM2.1 predicts **zero propagation delay** between gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from the same source.

Both GW (tensor mode) and EM (photon) travel at exactly c through the NZEF/IGA.

**Redshift mechanism:** Inelastic forward scattering in –E domains — photon loses energy to the equilibrium bath, arrives on time but redshifted.

No classical phase delay (n > 1) → no timing offset.

Observed delays (e.g., GW170817 ~1.7 s) are source physics (jet breakout, cocoon).

**Testable signatures:**
- EM redshift without propagation delay
- Achromatic lensing
- Sharp images across wavelengths

Future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events with prompt EM counterparts will test this directly.
